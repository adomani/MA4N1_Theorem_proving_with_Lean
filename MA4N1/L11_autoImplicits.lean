#  Setting `autoImplicit` true or false

Lean's default set-up involves a feature called `autoImplicit`.
This means that if you start typing code in a fresh `Lean` file,
`Lean` will try hard to make sense of what you are doing,
assuming *you* know exactly what you are doing!

The conclusion is that
* `set_option autoImplicit false` makes sure that `Lean` interprets as
  syntax errors all typos;
* `set_option relaxedAutoImplicit false` makes sure that `Lean` interprets as
  syntax errors all typos, except the *one-letter ones*.

My view on `autoImplicit`s is mixed:
* on the one hand, it is convenient to not have to introduce each symbol,
  and it feels good automation when `Lean` "gets it";
* on the other hand, it is *very* easy to actually have typos when you are
  writing code and not receiving feedback about this, since `Lean` interpreted
  your typo as an implicitly defined variable can be annoying.

For this reason, you may have noticed that, in most of the live-coding that happened
in the lectures, I ended up writing `set_option autoImplicit false` near the beginning
of the file.

##  Change `autoImplicit` defaults

Over the week-end, I have changed the default for this project:
`autoImplicit`s are now disabled by default on `MA4N1`.

*Warning.*
`Lean` projects will likely have `autoImplicit`s on by default.

In order to change the `autoImplicit` setting for a whole project,
you should edit `lakefile.lean`.

Find the part of the code beginning with

`package «my_project» where [...]`

or
`package «my_project» := { [...]`

and convert it to
```lean
package «my_project» where
  -- add any package configuration options here
  moreServerOptions := #[⟨`autoImplicit, false⟩]
```

Notice that `set_option [whatever]` are *scoped*:
if you only want to have some `autoImplicit` behaviour in some part of the code,
but not another, this would work.

Another potential issue is capitalization.

Lean is very much aware of capitalization!
Names that differ only in their capitalization are considered *different* by Lean.

In the old `Lean 3` days, the convention for almost every name was that they would
be written in all lower-case letters and replacing spaces (` `) by underscores (`_`).

Conventions changed in `Lean 4`, so now you see a big variation on upper/lower-case,
spaces and underscores in declaration names.
There are some [naming conventions](https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/naming.html),
but the rules are not completely straightforward and the (deprecated) habit from `Lean 3` is hard
to loose.

  --  * the output of `Try this` is `tac [...]`.
  --  This has several benefits:
  --  * the output of `tac?` may be very long and cluttered, but the call `tac?`

  --  * the execution of `tac [...]` may be much faster than `tac` or `tac?`
  --  * if we change a lemma in the output of `tac?`, but `tac?` still works,
