#  Generalizations, automation, `exact?`, `simp`, tactics

As it happens, someone comes along and says:

"I just learned a cool fact!  A polynomial with coefficients in `ℕ` is monotone!"

Let's formalize this result!

Let's also think about what it really means...

Surely they intended to say that viewing a polynomial with coefficients in `ℕ`
as a function `ℕ → ℕ`, we obtain a monotone function.

### import

tells Lean to learn basic mathematical facts
-/
import Mathlib.Tactic

/-
### namespace

means that if we construct something and we call it `X`
its real name is going to be `TPwL.X`.
useful to avoid name-clashes with pre-existing objects.
-/
namespace TPwL_generalizations

/-
### open

`open whatever` instructs Lean that when we refer
to `X`, it should look for `X` or `whatever.X`.

`namespace`s are ubiquitous, thus `open` allows us to avoid
constantly writing `Function.[...]` or `Polynomial.[...]`.

### variables

`variables (x : X)` means that, from now on
(within the current `section`/`namespace`/...), if we write `x`
and Lean does not already know what `x` means, then it tries
to see if `(x : X)` works and uses it.

Useful to avoid repetitions in a group of results that have
common assumptions and notation.
-/
variable  (f : ℕ[X])        -- `f` is a polynomial with coefficients in `ℕ`
          (P : ℕ[X] → Prop) -- `P` is a property of polynomials: `P f` may be
                            -- true or false

/-
### Digression on `Prop`

`Prop` is the "generic Type of propositions".  Most of the times, you can
think of this as `True/False`.
(The Type of "actual" `true/false` is called `Bool` -- note the difference
in capitalization: `true : Bool` while `True : Prop`.
This will be only superficially relevant.)

Thus, when we write `P : ℕ[X] → Prop` we are introducing a function `P`
that takes a polynomial with coefficients in `ℕ` and returns `True`
or `False`.  For instance, "being monic" could be one such function.
Also, "the leading coefficient of `f` equals the first decimal digit
of the `deg f`-th odd perfect number, if it exists, and `1` otherwise".

### theorem/lemma

Presumably, you already know about this.

The syntax is
  `theorem <name_of_theorem> <hypotheses> : <conclusion> := <proof>`

* <name_of_theorem> is the identifier that we can then use to refer to it.
  It is like a `\label` in laTex.

* <hypotheses> is where we list the assumptions that we make.
  For instance `(a : ℕ)` or `[CommGroup G]` or `(f : ℕ → ℝ)` or
  `(Goldbach: ∀ n : ℕ, ∃ p q, Prime p ∧ Prime q ∧ p + q = n)`.

  Bonus: to "see" Type-inference at work, look at the outputs of
  ```lean
  #check     ∀ n, ∃ p q, Prime p ∧ Prime q ∧ p + q = n
  #check ∀ n : ℕ, ∃ p q, Prime p ∧ Prime q ∧ p + q = n
  ```

* <proof> is the actual proof term.
  Usually, this is a sequence of tactics inside a `by ... done` block.

### example

The same (almost) as `theorem`, except that we cannot assign it a name.
-/
example : Monotone (fun n ↦ f.eval n) :=
by
  apply my_induction f _
  · -- show that the `0`-polynomial is monotone
    simp
    exact?
    -- we can compact this to `simp [monotone_const]` or more explicitly `simp only [eval_zero, monotone_const]`
  · -- if two polynomials are monotone, then so is their sum
    intros f g hf hg
    -- use that the sum of two monotone functions is monotone
    -- we can find the name of the lemma using auto-completion (Ctrl-Space) and guessing
    convert Monotone.add hf hg
    simp
  · -- show that monomials are monotone
    intros
    simp
    apply Monotone.pow_right
    apply monotone_id

Now that we proved it for `ℕ`, let's generalize to `ℝ≥0`.

Copy-paste the above, change `ℕ` to `ℝ≥0` and fix the issues.

Now that we proved it for `ℕ` and for `ℝ≥0`, let's generalize further.

Copy-paste the above and look for a common generalization of `ℕ` and `ℝ≥0`.

Finally, let's confirm that the more general result proves to the special cases that we know.
