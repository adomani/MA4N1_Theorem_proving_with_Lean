# [MA4N1 Theorem Proving with Lean](https://adomani.github.io/Syllabus/MA4N1/toc)

This is the repository for the module [MA4N1 Theorem Proving with Lean](https://adomani.github.io/Syllabus/MA4N1/toc) at the University of Warwick.

Here, you will find the Lean files used during lectures, some exercises and various complements.

This is a Lean project with `Mathlib` as a dependency.
You may want to set-up something like this for your group project.
You can find instructions on how to do this at [this webpage](https://adomani.github.io/Syllabus/MA4N1/instructions_for_new_project).
For systems other than Unix, take a look at the [Mathlib projects webpage](https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/project.html#creating-a-lean-project).
